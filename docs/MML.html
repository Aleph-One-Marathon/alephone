<title>The Marathon Markup Language</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<h3>Introduction</h3>

The Marathon Markup Language (MML), a subset of the Extensible Markup Language (XML):
This was created for the purpose of configuring the Marathon engine in a non-hardcoded way.
MML scripts are stored in the "Scripts" subdirectory of the local data directory, and the "MML" subdirectory of the global data directories and accessed in alphabetical order
(scripts in the local directory are read after the global ones so they can
override their settings).
<p>

Most modern IDEs or text editors can modify XML files. For more information on XML, check out this link:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.xml.com">xml.com; has lots of XML-related stuff</a>
</ul>

One feature that I've attempted to maintain is that any set of values
can always be overrode by another.
For example, if you set some color to be red in one file,
and that color to be green in a file processed after it,
that color will be green.
<p>

Many of the element attributes here are some sort of index value,
and they are all counted from 0 unless specified otherwise;
for example, collections are numbered from 0 to 31.
<p>


Here is the format:
<p>

<h3><a name="marathon">Marathon Root Element: &lt;marathon&gt;</a></h3>

This is the root element, the one that contains all the others.
Other Marathon-related root elements may be defined in the future, however,
such as root elements for stuff that is intended for individual map levels.
These may have a format like &lt;maralevel index="value"&gt;.
<p>

This element has no attributes and contains these child elements:

<h3><a name="stringset">String-Set Element: &lt;stringset&gt;</a></h3>

This element is an imitation of MacOS 'STR#' resources. It has an attribute of "index",
which has a numerical value corresponding to the original resource ID:

<ol start="128">
<li>Errors
<li>Filenames
<li>Top-Level Interface Items
<li>Prompts
<li>Network Errors
<li>Key Codes to Names
<li>Preferences Advice
<li>Computer Interface
<li>Join Dialog Messages
<li>Weapon Names
<li>File Search Path
<li>Preferences Groupings
<li>Postgame Network Game Statistics
<li>Net Game Setup
<li>New Join Dialog Messages
<li>Progress Strings for Networking
<li value="145">Difficulty Level Names</li>
<li value="150">Item Names
<li>Item types
<li>Player and Team Color Names</li>
<li>Net Statistics Strings
<li value="200">OpenGL-Option Color-Picker Prompts
</ol>

This element contains child elements with form &lt;string&gt;,
which have an attribute of "index",
and contents of whatever the string is supposed to be.
The index is zero-based, unlike the original STR# resources, whose indices are one-based.
For example, the filenames are specified in this fashion:

<pre>
&lt;!-- STR# Resource: "Filenames" --&gt;
&lt;stringset index="129"&gt;
&lt;string index="0"&gt;Shapes&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="1"&gt;Shapes.16&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="2"&gt;Sounds&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="3"&gt;Sounds.16&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="4"&gt;Aleph One Preferences&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="5"&gt;Map&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="6"&gt;Untitled Game&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="7"&gt;Marathon&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="8"&gt;Aleph One Recording&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="9"&gt;Physics Model&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="10"&gt;Music&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="11"&gt;Images&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string index="12"&gt;Movie&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/stringset&gt;
</pre>

<h3><a name="interface">Interface-Stuff Element: &lt;interface&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element specifies stuff used in the heads-up display (HUD).
It has one attribute, "motion_sensor", which is <a href="#boolean">boolean</a>,

<pre>
&lt;interface&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;vidmaster stringset_index="1234" /&gt;
&lt;/interface&gt;
<br>
&lt;stringset index="1234"&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;string index="0"&gt;Before proceeding any further, you&lt;/string&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;string index="1"&gt;must take the oath of the vidmaster:&lt;/string&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;string index="2"&gt;&lt;/string&gt; &lt;!-- empty string for line break --&gt;

<h3><a name="motsens">Motion-Sensor Element: &lt;motion_sensor&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element is for assigning motion-sensor features;
the assignment is done by doing &lt;assign&gt;, which has attributes "monster"
(which one of these in the list) and "type", which is
<ol type=1 start="0">
<li>Self, Friendly Player, and Bob
<li>Alien
<li>Hostile Player
</ol>
<p>

One can disable it by specifying that the top-level element
<a href="#interface">&lt;interface&gt;</a>
has attribute "motion_sensor" with value "false".
<p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="ovhdmap">Overhead-Map Element: &lt;overhead_map&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element is for setting up overhead-map features.
It can have an attribute of "mode", which has possible values:
<ol type=1 start="0">
<li>Normal: automapping is cumulative (the default)
<li>Currently visible only
<li>All
</ol>
<p>

It can also have the attribute "title_offset", whose value is how many pixels downward
to offset the title text.
<p>

One can assign various types to monsters; they can either never show up,
or else show up as a Bob or as an alien.
This must be done separately for living and dead monsters,
because the engine "forgets" what monster type a dead monster is.
<p>

Thus, one assigns live monsters with &lt;assign_live&gt; and dead ones with
&lt;assign_dead&gt;.
Which live monster to assign one specifies with an attribute "monster",
which takes a monster type, while which dead monster to assign one specified
with an attribute of "coll", which takes a collection ID.
Both elements assign to a type of display, specified with attribute "type";
the possible types are:
<ol start="-1">
<li>won't ever show up
<li>Bob (shown by default)
<li>Alien (not shown by default)
</ol>
<p>

One can display additional stuff by specifying an appropriate element;
this elements have an attribute of "on", which is a 
<a href="#boolean">boolean</a> value.
<ul>
<li>&lt;aliens&gt;: shows characters other than players and Bobs
<li>&lt;items&gt;: shows anything that can be picked up
<li>&lt;projectiles&gt;: shows these
<li>&lt;paths&gt;: shows the paths that the monster AI has worked out
</ul>
<p>

Lines can be specified with the element &lt;line&gt;, which has these attributes,
all mandatory:
<ul>
<li>type:
<ol type=1 start="0">
<li>Wall (solid)
<li>Elevation (not solid; floor on one side higher than on the other side)
<li>Control panel (unused)
</ol>
<li>scale: 0 is minimum map scale and 3 is maximum map scale
<li>width: width value in pixels
</ul>

Colors can be specified with the element &lt;color&gt;, which is indexed;
For more on specifying colors, go <a href="#color">here</a>.
Here are what the colors are:
<ol type=1 start="0">
<li>Plain polygon
<li>Platform
<li>Water
<li>Lava
<li>Sewage
<li>JjaroGoo
<li>PfhorSlime
<li>Hill
<li>Solid Line
<li>Elevation Line
<li>Control Panel (unused)
<li>Bob Display
<li>Monster Display

<li>Checkpoint Display
<li>Annotation
<li>Map Title
<li>Path
<li>Minor Ouch
<li>Major Ouch
<li>Teleporter
</ol>
<p>

Fonts can be specified with the element &lt;font&gt;, which is indexed;
For more on specifying fonts, go <a href="#font">here</a>.
Here are what the fonts are:
<ol type=1 start="0">
<li>Annotation at scale 0 (lowest)
<li>Annotation at scale 1
<li>Annotation at scale 2
<li>Annotation at scale 3 (highest)
<li>Map title
</ol>

One can disable it by specifying that the top-level element
<a href="#view">&lt;view&gt;</a>
has attribute "map" with value "false".
<p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="infravision">Infravision Element: &lt;infravision&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element contains what is needed to specify infravision colors.
These are assigned by texture collection, and there are 4 colors to choose from.
The assignment is done with element &lt;assign&gt;, which has the attributes
"coll" (for collection) and "color" (for which one of the colors).
Here are the default colors:
<ol type=1 start="0">
<li>Aliens (red)
<li>Friends and Items (green)
<li>Walls and Scenery, also the S'pht (blue)
<li>Player Stuff and Explosion Effects (yellow)
</ol>
Colors can be specified with the element &lt;color&gt;, which is indexed;
For more on specifying colors, go <a href="#color">here</a>.
<p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="animtxtrs">Animated-Textures Element: &lt;animated_textures&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element is for specifying animated textures.
Animated textures are specified as sequences, which contain loops of texture frames
and various timing and phase information.
For example, suppose that a sequence contains frames (a,b,c).
As time goes on, frame a will be translated first into frame a, then into frame b,
then into frame c, and then will repeat the sequence, as shown below:
<p>

<table>
<tr>
<td>a</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>a</td>
<td>b</td>
<td>c</td>
<td>a</td>
<td>b</td>
<td>c</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>b</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>b</td>
<td>c</td>
<td>a</td>
<td>b</td>
<td>c</td>
<td>a</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>c</td>
<td>-</td>
<td>c</td>
<td>a</td>
<td>b</td>
<td>c</td>
<td>a</td>
<td>b</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>

This element has two kinds of child elements, &lt;clear&gt; and &lt;sequence&gt;.
<p>

The first one, &lt;clear&gt;, clears the sequences; if it has an attribute of "coll",
it will clear the sequences for the collection specified in that attribute's value;
if not, it will clear all the sequences.
However, this command can be followed by commands to create sequences,
which will then be executed as if no "clear" command had been issued.
<p>

The second one, &lt;sequence&gt;, specifies the sequences themselves.
It takes these attributes:
<ul>
<li>coll: which collection (mandatory)
<li>numticks: how many engine ticks to stay at each frame (mandatory)
<lI>framephase: how many frames ahead to start (optional: default = 0)
<li>tickphase: how many ticks into a frame to start (optional: default = 0)
<li>select: for choosing some frame to translate into the loop of frames
as if it was the first one; this frame need not be a member of the loop.
If this is -1, then it is the frames in the loop that are translated.
(optional: default = -1; use the loop frames)
</ul>
<p>

This one also contains a child element, &lt;frame&gt;, which has a mandatory
attribute of "index", which is the frame's index.
There must be at least one of these in a sequence, for rather obvious reasons.
<p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="controlpanels">Control-Panels Element: &lt;control_panels&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element specifies various control-panel features,
such as what kind it is, what items it accepts, and so forth.
It has these attributes:
<ul>
<li>reach: the maximum distance one can reach to touch a control panel,
in World Units (default: 1.5)
<li>horiz: how compressed-to-horizontal the reaching must be;
no compression is 1 (default: 2)
<li>single_energy: how much the single-energy panel recharges (default: 150)
<li>single_energy_rate: the single-energy panel's recharge rate (default: 1)
<li>double_energy: how much the double-energy panel recharges (default: 300)
<li>double_energy_rate: the double-energy panel's recharge rate (default: 2)
<li>triple_energy: how much the triple-energy panel recharges (default: 450)
<li>triple_energy_rate: the triple-energy panel's recharge rate (default: 3)
</ul>
<p>

Each kind of control panel is specified with the child element
&lt;panel&gt;, which has these attributes:
<ul>
<li>index: which one of the types of control panel (mandatory)
<li>type: what that control panel does
<li>coll: which shapes collection
<li>active_frame: which frame when the panel is active
<li>inactive_frame: which frame when the panel is inactive
<li>pitch: what pitch of panel-active sound
<li>item: what item the panel accepts (-1 is none)
</ul>
This element has an optional child element, "sound", with two attributes,
both mandatory: type and which.
The type indicates when the sound is to play, while which is the index in
the list of sound definitions (-1 means none).
<p>

The map files themselves reference control panels by definition;
here are the default control-panel definitions:

<h3><a name="liquids">Liquids (Medias) Element: &lt;liquids&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element specifies various liquid features,
such as how deadly a liquid is, and so forth.
Each individual liquid type is specified with a &lt;liquid&gt; child element,
which has these attributes:
<ul>
<li>index: which one of the liquid types (mandatory)
<li>coll: which shapes collection
<li>frame: which frame
<li>transfer: this is the texture-rendering transfer mode.
<li>damage_freq: this is for indicating how often to apply a liquid's damage.
This is bitwise-ANDed with the number of engine ticks,
and damage gets applied if the result is all zeros.
Thus, if this quantity has a value of (2^n-1), then damage will be applied
every (2^n) ticks.
<li>submerged: this is the fader used to do the submerged appearance;
its default index values are those of their liquids.
</ul>
The index value is which one of these liquid types:
<ol type=1 start="0">
<li>Water
<li>Lava
<li>Pfhor
<li>Sewage
<li>Jjaro
</ol>
while the "submerged" value is which one of these liquid types
<ol type=1 start="0">
<li>Water
<li>Lava
<li>Sewage
<li>Jjaro
<li>Pfhor
</ol>
This element also has child elements &lt;damage&gt;
(how much damage; it is described in greater detail <a href="#damage">here</a>),
&lt;effect&gt; and &lt;sound&gt;.
The latter two have two attributes, both mandatory: type and which.
The type indicates when to make the effect / sound, while which is the index in
the list of effect or sound definitions (-1 means none).
<p>

The effects:
<ol type=1 start="0">
<li>Small Detonation
<li>Medium Detonation
<li>Large Detonation
<li>Large Emergence
</ol>

<p>

It has child elements that specify which ambient, random, and dialog
sound assignments to use, and also which external files to use, if
desired.  The ambient, random, and dialog sound assigments are
assignments from their indices to the list of (general) sound
definitions, and are specified with child elements &lt;ambient&gt;,
&lt;random&gt;, and &lt;dialog&gt;.  Each of them has these
attributes, both mandatory:
<ul>
<li>index: which one of the ambient or random sound types

<h3><a name="faders">Fader Elements: &lt;faders&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element is for specifying various fader features,
the faders being what causes the whole screen to change color
when one is underneath a liquid or getting hit by something.
It has two kinds of child elements, &lt;fader&gt; and &lt;liquid&gt;.
<p>

The first kind, &lt;fader&gt;, specifies features of each individual fader;
it has attributes
<ul>
<li>index: which fader
<li>type: which type of fade effect to apply
<li>initial_opacity (floating point: 0 = none, 1 = complete)
<li>final_opacity (floating point: 0 = none, 1 = complete)
<li>period: time for fader effect to complete, in milliseconds
<li>flags: various features; get this value by adding the numerical values
corresponding to the desired features:
<ol>
<li><tt>(hex 0001)</tt> Full screen
<li><tt>(hex 0002)</tt> Random transparency; makes flickering effect
</ol>
<li>priority: higher is higher priority
</ul>
and a child element &lt;color&gt;, which is not indexed.
For more on specifying colors, go <a href="#color">here</a>.
The fader types are these:
<ol type=1 start="0">
<li>Tint: fade to the fader's color value:<br>
[new color] = [old color] + ([fader color] - [old color])*[opacity]
<li>Randomize: do random shifts of the colors:<br>
[new color] = [old color] + [opacity]*[random numbers]
<li>Negate: darkens light colors and lightens dark colors. For each channel:<br>
[opacity complement] = 1 - [opacity]<br>
if [old color] &gt; 0.5 then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[new color] = max([old color], xor([fader color], [old color]) + [opacity complement])<br>
else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[new color] = min([old color], xor([fader color], [old color]) - [opacity complement])<br>
Intermediate results may be out of (0,1) range.
<li>Dodge: some weird processing. For each channel:<br>
[new color] = max([old color], 1 - (1 - [fader color])*[old color] - [opacity])<br>
Intermediate results may be out of (0,1) range.
<li>Burn: some weird processing. For each channel:<br>
[opacity complement] = 1 - [opacity]<br>
[new color] = max([old color],[fader color]*[old color] + [opacity complement])<br>
Intermediate results may be out of (0,1) range.
<li>Soft tint: fade to the fader's color value multiplied by the intensity
(maximum of color-channel values):<br>
[intensity] = max(color channels of [old color])<br>
[new color] = [old color] + ([fader color]*[intensity] - [old color])*[opacity]
</ol>
In all these equations, color values are from 0 (black) to 1 (white),
and out-of-range result values are reduced to that range by subtracting whichever integer
will put the result into that range.
<p>

The second kind, &lt;liquid&gt;, specifies faders for liquids;
it has attributes
<ul>
<li>index: which liquid to apply the fader to
<li>fader: this specifies which fader to use for this liquid.
<li>opacity: how strong is the fader effect (floating point: 0 = none, 1 = complete)
</ul>
The index is which one of these liquid types:
<ol type=1 start="0">
<li>Water
<li>Lava
<li>Sewage
<li>Jjaro
<li>Pfhor
</ol>
<p>

then fader (fade)+1 is used instead of fader (fade).
<li>fade: what of the faders to use.
<li>sound: Sound to make.

<li>Flaming death
</ol>
</ul>
If there is none of something, then it gets a value of -1.

It has these attributes
<ul>
<li>invisibility (default: 2100 or 70 seconds)
<li>invincibility (default: 1500 or 50 seconds)
<li>extravision (default: 5400 or 3 minutes)
<li>infravision (default: 5400 or 3 minutes)
</ul>
These have a value of the number of engine ticks the powerup lasts;
an engine tick is 1/30 second.

</ul>
If one turns some ammo or other non-powerup item into a powerup, be sure to set its item type to be "powerup"
with the <a href="#items">items</a> element.
<p>

Player shapes can be set with an element of &lt;shape&gt;, which differs from the usual element with that name;
the player shapes have an overall collection and various sequences,
and each element will set either that collection or one of the sequences.
It has these attributes, all of which are mandatory:
<ul>
<li>type: overall type of shape value
<li>subtype: more specific type: depends on which overall type
<li>value: the shape value to use

<p>

The default on-screen font is "Monaco", size 12, normal style;
for more on setting fonts, go <a href="#font">here</a>.
<p>

Field-of-view features are set with child element &lt;fov&gt;,
which has these attributes:
<ul>
<li>normal: the normal field of view (default: 80)
<li>extra: the extravision-powerup field of view (default: 130)
<li>tunnel: the tunnel-vision field of view, good for long-distance sharpshooting

The kick for each damage type is specified with a &lt;kick&gt; child element,
which has these attributes:
<ul>
<li>index: which "true" damage type (mandatory)
<li>base: quantity of kick that is always present
<li>mult: how much to multiply the damage amount by to obtain an additional kick
<li>vertical: indicates whether the kick will have a vertical component

<li>Soft death (stays in shape)
<li>Flaming death
</ol>
</ul>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3><a name="monsters">Monsters Element: &lt;monsters&gt;</a></h3>
This element specifies additional characteristics of monsters. Each
monster type is specified with a &lt;monster&gt; child element, which
has these attributes:
<ul>
<li>index: which monster type (mandatory)
<li>must_be_exterminated: if true, this monster must be killed in order for an extermination level to be completed (<a href="#boolean">boolean</a>)

<hr>

<h3><a name="scenery">Scenery Element: &lt;scenery&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element specifies various features of scenery objects,
including size and solidity.
Each individual type of scenery object is specified with a &lt;object&gt; child element,
which has these attributes:
<ul>
<li>index: which one of the scenery-object types (mandatory)
<li>flags: various features; get this value by adding the numerical values
corresponding to the desired features:
<ol>
<li><tt>(hex 0001)</tt> Solid (can't pass through it)
<li><tt>(hex 0002)</tt> Unused
<li value="4"><tt>(hex 0004)</tt> Destroyable
</ol>
<li>radius: horizontal dimension in internal units, for doing collision detection.
<li>height: vertical dimension like above; if negative,
then object's extent downward from reference point (good for ceiling objects).
<li>destruction: effect to make when destroyed (-1 is none).
</ul>
<p>

This element's shapes can be specified with child elements
&lt;normal&gt; and &lt;destroyed&gt;, for before-and-after shapes;
each of them has the actual shape value specified with a
<a href="#shape">shape</a> child element.
<p>

Some notes on the flags:
<p>

"Destroyable" is not meaningful unless the object is also "solid";
this is because a projectile must collide with the object in order to destroy it.
Thus, a solid but indestructible object would get flags="1",
and a destroyable one would get flags="5".
<p>

<h3><a name="landscapes">Landscapes Element: &lt;landscapes&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element is for modifying landscape rendering.

This element has two kinds of child elements, &lt;clear&gt; and &lt;landscape&gt;.
<p>

The first one, &lt;clear&gt;, clears the landscape options,
setting them back to their defaults; if it has an attribute of "coll",
it will clear the sequences for the collection specified in that attribute's value;
if not, it will clear all the sequences.
However, this command can be followed by commands to set up landscape options,
which will then be executed as if no "clear" command had been issued.
<p>

The second one, &lt;landscape&gt;, specifies the landscape options themselves.
It takes these attributes:
<ul>
<li>coll: which collection (mandatory)
<li>frame: which frame to apply the options to (default: -1, all frames)
<li>horiz_exp: exponent for power of 2 that is the number of wraparound repeats in the horizontal direction.
(default: 1 - two repeats)
<li>vert_exp: exponent for power of 2 that makes a vertical scaling equal to the scaling
produced by the same value of horiz_exp in the horizontal direction. (default: 1 - equal to two horizontal repeats)
<li>ogl_asprat_exp: exponent for power of 2 that is the ratio of width to height
of the part of the texture that OpenGL will use (width is fixed; height can be variable).
This part will always be centered in height, and will either include some untextured area
or will not include the top and bottom parts. (default: 1 -- height is 1/2 width)
<li>vert_repeat: whether texture repeats in the vertical direction
(default: false -- mirrored or clamped in the vertical direction, depending on video card support)
<li>azimuth: angle in degrees to rotate the texture leftward relative to the map.
	This could be useful for aligning landscape features with map ones. (default: 0)
<li>projection: projection to use (default: 0 -- cylinder)
</ul>
<p>
Here are the projections:
<ol type=1 start="0">
<li>Cylinder
<li>Sphere map (hardware acceleration only; ignores all exp and repeat settings for now, and instead always uses a 2:1 ratio 360°x180° sphere map texture)
</ol>
<p>

<h3><a name="textureloading">Texture-Loading Element: &lt;texture_loading&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element is for setting what textures are to be loaded.
It has one attribute, "landscapes",  which is <a href="#boolean">boolean</a>;
it indicates whether or not to load M2/Moo-style landscapes (collections 26 to 30).
It also has a child element, &lt;texture_env&gt;, for indicating what wall-texture and
scenery collections are to be loaded.
It takes these attributes, all mandatory:
<ul>
<li>index: which one of the texture environments (water, lava, sewage, etc.)
<li>which: which position in the texture-environment definition (0 = first, etc;).
There are currently 7 such positions available.
<li>coll: which collection in that position; -1 is no collection.
</ul>
<p>

The defaults for Marathon 2/oo are, in order (walls, scenery):
<ol type=1 start="0">
<li>17, 22 -- Lh'owon Water
<li>18, 23 -- Lh'owon Lava
<li>19, 24 -- Lh'owon Sewage
<li>20, 25 -- Jjaro
<li>21, 26 -- Pfhor
</ol>
<p>

Those for Marathon 1 are, in order (walls, control panels, scenery):
<ol type=1 start="0">
<li>17, 8, 23 -- Marathon Set 1
<li>18, 8, 23 -- Marathon Set 2
<li>19, 8, 23 -- Marathon Set 3
<li>2, 24, 25 -- Pfhor
</ol>
<p>

Note also that Marathon 1 has its landscapes in the wall-texture collections;
the attribute "landscapes" is to be false for it.
<p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="opengl">OpenGL-Rendering Element: &lt;opengl&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element is for modifying the OpenGL rendering.
Currently, both texture-rendering modification and fog are supported;
texture-rendering modification modifies the rendering of each bitmap.

This element has these kinds of child elements, &lt;txtr_clear&gt;, &lt;texture&gt;,
&lt;model_clear&gt;, &lt;model&gt;, and &lt;fog&gt;.
<p>


The first one, &lt;txtr_clear&gt;, clears the texture options,
setting them back to their defaults. If it has an attribute of "coll",
it will clear the sequences for the collection specified in that attribute's value;
if not, it will clear all the sequences.
However, this command can be followed by commands to set up texture options,
which will then be executed as if no "txtr_clear" command had been issued.
<p>

The next one, &lt;texture&gt;, specifies the texture options themselves.
It takes these attributes:
<ul>
<li>coll: which collection (mandatory).
<li>clut: which color table. Values 0 to 7 are the familiar color-table values,
and -1 (default) sets options for all color tables not individually set.
<li>clut_variant: which drawing modes the options apply to:
<ol start="-1">
<li>All modes
<li>Normal (default)
<li>Infravision
<li>Silhouette [used for invisibility and static effect]
</ol>
The value -1 is equivalent to writing three &lt;texture&gt; elements for each of the three drawing modes.<br>
Note: the options for &lt;clut="-1" clut_variant="0"&gt; are used as the fallback if more specific options are not found. This fallback is used even for infravision and silhouette textures.
<li>bitmap: which one to apply the options to (mandatory).
<li>opac_type: what type of opacity to use (default: 0 -- crisp edges).
<li>opac_scale: scaling value for the opacity;
how much to multiply it by (default: 1 -- no change).
<li>opac_shift: shift value for the opacity;
how much to add after multiplying (default: 0 -- no change).
<li>normal_image: the name of the file whose image content to substitute
in "normal" rendering (sensitive to light levels).
<li>normal_mask: the name of the file whose image content becomes the opacity mask
for "normal" rendering (sensitive to light levels).
It must be used with a normal_image file.
<li>actual_width: if specified, only the leftmost number of pixels will be used from the _image and _mask files. Use this for small images embedded into a square DDS file, for example.
<li>actual_height: if specified, only the topmost number of pixels will be used from the _image and _mask files.
<li>glow_image: the name of the file whose image content to substitute
in "glowing" rendering (independent of light levels).
<li>glow_mask: the name of the file whose image content becomes the opacity mask
for "glowing" rendering (independent of light levels).
It must be used with a glow_image file.
<li>minimum_glow_intensity: the threshold at which "glowing" images are independent of light levels. Above this threshold, normal lighting calculations are used. (default: 1 -- always light at full intensity)
<li>offset_image: the name of the file whose image content to use for bump mapping (normals in RGB channels, height map in alpha channel).
<li>type: the texture type to use for image quality adjustments. If not set, the image quality settings in graphics preferences will be ignored for this image, and the largest version in the file used.
<li>normal_premultiply: the normal image uses premultiplied alpha (default: false, the image does not use premultiplied alpha)
<li>glow_premultiply: the glow image uses premultiplied alpha (default: false, the image does not use premultiplied alpha)
<li>normal_bloom_scale: when rendering bloom effects in the shader renderer, scale the normal image's light level by this amount. (default: 0 -- no light during bloom effect)
<li>normal_bloom_shift: when rendering bloom effects in the shader renderer, add this value to the normal image's light level after scaling. (default: 0)
<li>glow_bloom_scale: when rendering bloom effects in the shader renderer, scale the glow image's light level by this amount. (default: 1 -- full intensity during bloom effect)
<li>glow_bloom_shift: when rendering bloom effects in the shader renderer, add this value to the glow image's light level after scaling. (default: 0)
<li>landscape_bloom: when rendering bloom effects in the shader renderer, AND when the texture is used as a landscape, scale the image's light level by this amount. Note that glow images are not currently supported for landscapes. (default: 0.5)
<li>tile_ratio_exp: when applied to walls, scale replacement image up to cover 2^n x 2^n tiles. (default: 0, cover 1x1 tiles)
<li>billboard: when 3D perspective is enabled, choose axes to billboard sprites (default: -1, user preference)
</ul>
<p>
Note: all resulting values will be pegged to the range 0 to 1.
Here are the various opacity types:
<ol type=1 start="0">
<li>Crisp edges. The opacity threshold is 0.5.
<li>Fuzzy edges.
<li>Fuzzy edges with opacity = average of color channels.
<li>Fuzzy edges with opacity = maximum of color channels.
</ol>
<p>

The opacities of all but the first will be scaled and shifted
with opac_scale and opac_shift.
The first one of these is good for objects with well-defined edges;
the others are good for clouds, flames, energy-weapon bolts, and so forth,
which will not have sharp boundaries.
The average and maximum modes were included as a way of producing variable opacity
without adding any new files; this hack was inspired by the semitransparency handling
in the Tomb Raider series.
The idea here is that the brighter regions are likely to be the more opaque ones
in these cases.
I've put both of them in because they behave somewhat differently;
max has the same strength for saturated colors as for grays,
while mean has less strength for saturated colors than for grays.
<p>
Here are the texture types:
<ol type=1 start="0">
<li>Wall Textures
<li>Landscape Textures
<li>Inhabitants
<li>Weapons in hand
</ol>
<p>
Here are the billboard axes:
<ol type="1" start="0">
<li>Y: rotate with camera yaw, perpendicular to floor
<li>XY: rotate with camera yaw, tilt with camera pitch
</ol>
<p>
The following texture attributes are deprecated, may not work properly, and should no longer be used:
<ul>
<li>glow_blend
<li>image_scale
<li>normal_blend
<li>offset_x
<li>offset_y
<li>shape_height
<li>shape_width
<li>void_visible
<li>x_offset
<li>y_offset
</ul>
<p>
The values 8 and 9 for the "clut" attribute are deprecated and should no longer be used. Instead, use a "clut" value of -1 and a "clut_variant" of 1 or 2.
<p>

The next one, &lt;model_clear&gt;, clears all the model definitions;
it works much like &lt;txtr_clear&gt;.
<p>

The next one, &lt;model&gt; specifies a 3D model to be used in place
of some sequence. Models can either be static, having no built-in animations
(most 3D-model formats), or they can be dynamic, having such animations
(Brian Barnes's Dim3 model format, for example).
These animations are specified by sequence (animation in BB's terminology);
each sequence should have at least one frame.
There is one special "sequence", the neutral pose, which indicates a model
with no animations applied.
This element takes child elements &lt;seq_map&gt; and &lt;skin&gt;, and these attributes:
<ul>
<li>coll: which collection (mandatory).
<li>seq: which sequence in the Marathon engine.
Checked after the sequence mapping is searched for a sequence;
it may be omitted if a sequence mapping is being used.
Recommended for use with static models;
for dynamic models, it maps onto the model's neutral pose.
<li>file: the name of the file containing the model data.
For static models, this is the only file,
for Dim3 models, this is the "mesh" file (basic model data).
<li>file1: an extra model-data file. Unnecessary for static models;
for Dim3 models, this is the "pose" file (frames).
<li>file2: an extra model-data file. Unnecessary for static models;
for Dim3 models, this is the "animate" file (sequences).
<li>type: a string identifying the model-data format:
<ul>
<li>Alias|Wavefront Object: "obj"
<li>3D Studio Max Object: "max"
<li>QuickDraw 3D / Quesa 3D Metafile: "qd3d" or "3dmf" or "quesa"
<li>Brian Barnes Dim3 animated model: "dim3"
</ul>
The following types are also accepted, but have known bugs and are only present for backward compatibility:
<ul>
<li>Alias|Wavefront Object: "wave" to "wavefront"
<li>3D Studio Max Object: "3ds" to "3ds max" or "3dsmax"
</ul>
If it is absent, the type will then be guessed from the file contents,
an operation that may work on some file formats but not others.
<li>scale: how much to scale the model before rendering,
from model coordinates to internal coordinates.
A negative scale will cause the model to be reflected around all three axes
(default: 1).
<li>x_rot: rotation in degrees around the x-axis (default: 0).
<li>y_rot: rotation in degrees around the y-axis (default: 0).
<li>z_rot: rotation in degrees around the z-axis (default: 0).
<li>x_shift: shift in internal units in the x direction (default: 0).
<li>y_shift: shift in internal units in the y direction (default: 0).
<li>z_shift: shift in internal units in the z direction (default: 0).
<li>side: which side is visible (default: clockwise):
<ul>
<li>+: clockwise side
<li>0: both sides
<li>-: counterclockwise side
</ul>
<li>norm_type: which sort of normals to use for doing the lighting (default: originals)
<ol type=1 start="0">
<li>None
<li>Original-model normals (may be none)
<li>Reverse-direction original-model normals (may be none)
<li>Normals in the direction of the polygons' clockwise sides
<li>Normals in the direction of the polygons' counterclockwise sides
</ol>
<li>norm_split: threshold for spltting the vertex normals
for clockwise-side or counterclockwise-side normals;
if the normals' standard deviation is greater than this value,
then a vertex's normal is split into one for each of its polygons.
(default: 0.5)
<li>light_type: what sort of lighting to use (default: fast)
<ol type=1 start="0">
<li>Fast lighting; only one calculation of the player light
<li>Like above, but the player light won't fade off on the sides
<li>Individual-vertex calculation of the player light (more accurate, but slower)
<li>Like above, but the player light won't fade off on the sides
</ol>
<li>depth_type: what sort of depth to use in the depth sorting
<ul>
<li>+: Farthest bounding-box point (good for all-or-nothing-opacity objects)
<li>0: Center of bounding box
<li>-: Nearest bounding-box point (good for semitransparent objects)
</ul>
Ideally, objects with all-or-nothing opacity ought to be rendered
before semitransparent ones;
these different depth options offer a way to approximate that effect.
<li>force_sprite_depth: require sprites to be depth-sorted inside the model (default: false)<br>
This flag, active only in the shader renderer, will force sprites to strictly obey the Z-buffer. This allows sprites to be drawn correctly between different sections of a model (good for open models, like a house), but at the expense of clipping artifacts between sprites and walls/floors. In the default case, sprites are drawn entirely behind or entirely in front of the model. Use this flag sparingly, as the side effects are quite noticeable.
</ul>
<p>
The scaling and rotations will be applied before the shifts;
the rotations will be applied in order x, y, and z.
<p>

Its child element of &lt;seq_map&gt; is the sequence-mapping element,
has these attributes, both mandatory:
<ul>
<li>seq: sequence in the Marathon engine to map to.
<li>model_seq: sequence in the model, starting from 0.
The model sequence -1 is the neutral pose.
</ul>
A model element can have several such elements,
covering many of a collection's sequences.
<p>

The model element's child element of &lt;skin&gt; has these attributes,
which closely parallel those of &lt;texture&gt;:
<ul>
<li>clut: which color table (default: -1 -- all of them).
<li>clut_variant: which drawing modes the options apply to:
<ol start="-1">
<li>All modes
<li>Normal (default)
<li>Infravision
<li>Silhouette [used for invisibility and static effect]
</ol>
<li>opac_type: what type of opacity to use (default: 0 -- crisp edges).
<li>opac_scale: scaling value for the opacity;
how much to multiply it by (default: 1 -- no change).
<li>opac_shift: shift value for the opacity;
how much to add after multiplying (default: 0 -- no change).
<li>normal_image: the name of the file whose image content to substitute
in "normal" rendering (sensitive to light levels).
<li>normal_mask: the name of the file whose image content becomes the opacity mask
for "normal" rendering (sensitive to light levels).
It must be used with a normal_image file.
<li>glow_image: the name of the file whose image content to substitute
in "glowing" rendering (independent of light levels).
<li>glow_mask: the name of the file whose image content becomes the opacity mask
for "glowing" rendering (independent of light levels).
It must be used with a glow_image file.
<li>minimum_glow_intensity: the threshold at which "glowing" images are independent of light levels. Above this threshold, normal lighting calculations are used. (default: 1 -- always light at full intensity)
<li>normal_blend: which blend mode for semitransparent normal textures (default: 0 -- crossfade)
<li>glow_blend: which blend mode for semitransparent glowing textures (default: 0 -- crossfade)
<li>offset_image: the name of the file whose image content to use for bump mapping (normals in RGB channels, height map in alpha channel).
<li>normal_bloom_scale: when rendering bloom effects in the shader renderer, scale the normal image's light level by this amount. (default: 0 -- no light during bloom effect)
<li>normal_bloom_shift: when rendering bloom effects in the shader renderer, add this value to the normal image's light level after scaling. (default: 0)
<li>glow_bloom_scale: when rendering bloom effects in the shader renderer, scale the glow image's light level by this amount. (default: 1 -- full intensity during bloom effect)
<li>glow_bloom_shift: when rendering bloom effects in the shader renderer, add this value to the glow image's light level after scaling. (default: 0)
</ul>
<p>

The final one, &lt;fog&gt;, has these attributes:
<ul>
<li>type: which type of fog:
<ol type=1 start="0">
<li>Above liquid
<li>Below liquid
</ol>
The default is 0 (above liquid).
<li>on: (<a href="#boolean">boolean</a>; default: false)
<li>landscape_mix: how much fog to mix in to landscapes from 0 to 1 (default: 1.0)
<li>mode: the equation used to calculate the fog (default: 1)
<li>depth: the fog depth in World Units (default: 8)
<li>start: the start of fog in World Units (default: 0); only applies to linear fog
<li>landscapes: whether this fog affects landscape textures (default: true)
</ul>
<p>

and a <a href="#color">color</a> subelement, which indicates the fog color
(default: gray [red = green = blue = 0.5]).
<p>
Here are the fog modes:
<ol type=1 start="0">
<li>linear from start to (start + depth)
<li>exp with density = 1/depth
<li>exp2 with density = 1/depth
</ol>
<p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="software">Software Rendering Element: &lt;software&gt;</a></h3>
This kind of element is for modifying the software rendering. This element has the child element &lt;texture&gt;
<p>
&lt;texture&gt; specifies options for wall textures only, CLUT 0. It takes these attributes:
<ul>
<li>coll: which collection
<li>bitmap: which bitmap to apply the options to
<li>opac_type: what type of opacity to use (default: 0 -- no change).
<li>opac_scale: scaling value for the opacity; how much to multiply it by (default: 1 -- no change).
<li>opac_shift: shift value for the opacity; how much to add after multiplying (default: 0 -- no change).
</ul>
<p>
Here are the various opacity types:
<ol type=1 start="0">
<li>Crisp edges. Opacity is unaltered (this will cause no visible change in the software renderer).
<li>Fuzzy edges.
<li>Fuzzy edges with opacity = average of color channels.
<li>Fuzzy edges with opacity = maximum of color channels.
</ol>
<p>
In all cases, the wall texture's bitmap transparency definition is unaltered by opac_shift, opac_scale, and opac_type. Therefore, if a bitmap is marked transparent, the pixels that use color 0 will always be transparent, regardless of this MML.

<hr>

<h3><a name="dynlims">Dynamic-Limits Element: &lt;dynamic_limits&gt;</a></h3>

This kind of element specifies various dynamic limits,
more specifically, the maximum numbers of various entities whose quantity
varies during the game.
These are specified with various child elements, each one of which
has a mandatory attribute of "value", which is set to the appropriate number.
Here they are:

<ul>
<li> &lt;objects&gt; (default: 1024) Every sort of inhabitant object (players, monsters, items, projectiles, scenery)
<li> &lt;monsters&gt; (default: 512) Monsters / Non-Player Characters (NPC's).
<li> &lt;paths&gt; (default: 128) Paths for NPC's to follow; if not enough, they will not move.
<li> &lt;projectiles&gt; (default: 128) Bullets, missiles, flame, fist punches, etc.
<li> &lt;effects&gt; (default: 128) Explosions, splashes, etc.
<li> &lt;rendered&gt; (default: 1024) How many inhabitants to render at any one time.
<li> &lt;local_collision&gt; (default: 64) Target visibility, NPC-NPC collisions, etc.
<li> &lt;global_collision&gt; (default: 256) Projectiles with other objects
<li> &lt;ephemera&gt; (default: 4096) Lua-controlled effects
<li> &lt;garbage&gt; (default: 256) Corpses
<li> &lt;garbage_per_polygon&gt; (default: 10) Corpses in a single polygon
</ul>

<hr>

<h3><a name="playername">Player-Name Element: &lt;player_name&gt;</a></h3>

This is the default player name in netgames, which takes the form:
<pre>
&lt;player_name&gt;Marathon Player&lt;/player_name&gt;
</pre>
<p>

<hr>
<h3><a name="scenario">Scenario Element: &lt;scenario&gt;</a></h3>
This element is for identifying the scenario. It has three attributes, which are blank strings by default:

<ul>
<li>"name" - The scenario name displayed in the interface (Find Internet Game, About Aleph One). The name is also used to organize Quick Saves by scenario; if the scenario name changes, the user's previous quick saves will not be accessible. Limited to 32 characters.
<li>"id" - This string indicates network compatibility (see below). Limited to 24 characters.
<li>"version" - The scenario version displayed in the interface. Limited to 8 characters.
</ul>

Plugins can use any of the scenario attributes to determine whether they are compatibile. Most scenario-specific plugins will use scenario name.
<p>
The scenario id is used to gray out games in the Find Internet Game interface. Games show up as joinable when any of these are true:
<ul>
<li>The joiner's scenario id is blank</li>
<li>The gatherer's scenario id is blank</li>
<li>The joiner's scenario id matches the gatherer's scenario id</li>
<li>The gatherer's scenario id matches one of the joiner's can_join elements</li>
</ul>
All matches are case sensitive.
<p>
For example:
<p>
<pre>
&lt;scenario name="Marathon Infinity" id="Marathon Infinity"&gt;
&lt;can_join&gt;Marathon 2&lt;/can_join&gt;
&lt;/scenario&gt;
</pre>

The scenario element also supports these additional attributes:

<ul>
<li>"allow_classic_gameplay" - Whether to display the Solo Gameplay selector in the player prefs page. Defaults to false
</ul>

<hr>

<h3><a name="logging">Logging Configuration Element: &lt;logging&gt;</a></h3>

This element is used to configure Aleph One's logging behavior.  It has no attributes of its own.  Its single child element, &lt;logging_domain&gt;, requests particular logging behaviors for a logging domain.

<p>

The &lt;logging_domain&gt; element has the following attributes:

<ul>
<li>domain (string, required): names the logging domain whose behavior should be modified.  At the moment, the only logging domain is "global", in which all logging is currently done.
<li>threshhold (integer): only log messages at a level strictly lower than (i.e. less detailed than) the threshhold will appear.  See below for information about logging levels.
<li>show_locations (boolean): determines whether log entries will include source code filenames and line numbers.
<li>flush (boolean): determines whether output to the log file should be flushed after every log message (slower) or allowed to sit in a buffer for later writing (faster, but may fail to write log entries just before an application crash).
</ul>

The following are the currently-defined standard log levels:

<ol start="0">
<li>logFatalLevel: program must exit
<li value="10">logErrorLevel: can't do something significant
<li value="20">logWarningLevel: can continue but results could be really screwy
<li value="30">logAnomalyLevel: can continue, results could be off a little, but no big deal
<li value="40">logNoteLevel: something worth mentioning
<li value="50">logTraceLevel: details of actions and logic
<li value="60">logDumpLevel: values of data etc.
</ol>

Note that the &lt;threshhold&gt; attribute requires that the level be specified as an integer (but that it need not equal one of the standard levels), and further that log messages with level exactly equal to the threshhold level will NOT be seen.

<p>

Example:
<pre>
&lt;logging&gt;
&lt;logging_domain domain="global" threshhold="40" show_locations="true" flush="true"/&gt;
&lt;/logging&gt;
</pre>
This would set up the "global" logging domain such that only messages more important than "notes" would be seen; that source code filenames and line numbers would be included in the log; and that the log file would be flushed after every message, so a message logged just before an application crash would appear in the log file.

<p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="console">Console</a></h3>
The &lt;console&gt; tag controls messages typed into or printed to the screen. It has these attributes:

<ul>
<li>lua: <a href="#boolean">boolean</a>, enables a Lua interpreter in solo play, handy for debugging maps and scripts
</ul>

There are also child elements for macros and carnage messages:
<h4>Macros</h4>
Macros are substitutions performed on commands entered into the console. For instance, you can make a macro that changes &quot;.1&quot; into &quot;I'll defend&quot;. Macros can be used for chat, or to shorten other commands. Each macro child element has an input and an output attribute. To trigger the macro, type a dot immediately followed by the macro input into the console. 
<p>Macro inputs can be letters and numbers, but not spaces. Anything after the first space will remain unsubstituted. For instance, &quot;.1 you losers&quot; becomes &quot;I'll defend you losers&quot;
<p>
Example:
<pre>
&lt;console&gt;
&lt;macro input=&quot;1&quot; output=&quot;I'll defend&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/console&gt;
</pre>
<p>

<h4>Carnage Messages</h4>
Carnage messages are printed to the screen when a player is killed by himself or another player in a net game (assuming the gatherer has not disabled carnage messages). Each &lt;carnage_message&gt; tag has these attributes:
<ul>
<li>projectile_type: the type of projectile that triggers this message</li>
<li>on_kill: a string containing the message to print when one player kills another. In the string, %aggressor% will be replaced with the name of the player who did the killing, and %player% will be replaced with the name of the player who was killed.</li>
<li>on_suicide: a string containing the message to print when a player kills himself. In the string, %player% will be replaced with the name of the player who suicided.</li>
</ul>
A blank string (the default) results in nothing being printed.
<p>
Example:
<pre>
&lt;console&gt;
&lt;carnage_message projectile_type=&quot;14&quot; 
     on_kill=&quot;%aggressor% killed %player% with a SPNKR&quot; 
     on_suicide=&quot;%player% suicided with a SPNKR&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/console&gt;
</pre>

<h3><a name="levelscripts">Level Scripting</a></h3>

Unlike most MML elements, a level-script element can only live in a map file,
and it must be TEXT resource 128 or some equivalent, in order for its parser
to know where to find it.
Its root element is &lt;marathon_levels&gt; and not
&lt;marathon&gt;, to distinguish it from the usual sort of MML.
<p>

It has child elements &lt;level&gt;, &lt;end&gt;, &lt;default&gt;, &lt;restore&gt;,
and &lt;end_screens&gt;,
all but the last one specify what individual level scripts to execute. The element &lt;level&gt;
has a mandatory attribute, "index", which specifies which level the script is for;
the first one is index 0.
The element &lt;end&gt; specifies a script that is for the end of a game;
The element &lt;default&gt; specifies a script that is for the entire map file;
it is executed before a level's script is executed, for rather obvious reasons.
The element &lt;restore&gt; is intended to restore parameters to their A1 defaults
when switching to another map file; this is done because the parameters that the MML parser sets
are set in a "sticky" fashion,
and because saving and restoring default values inside the code
would require a whole lot of extra coding.
<p>

These elements have child elements that specify the script entries;
the entries are executed in the order that they are specified in the file.
This means that music files played in sequential order will be played in the order
that they are specified in, the first in the list played first, etc.
<ul>
<li>&lt;mml&gt; executes the MML script in the resource specified in the value of the attribute "resource"
<li>&lt;music&gt; plays the music file specified in the value of the attribute "file"
<li>&lt;random_order&gt; has the <a href="#boolean">boolean</a> attribute "on", which indicates whether
the music files are to be played in random order;
if not (the default), they are played in looping sequence.
<li>&lt;movie&gt; plays at the beginning of a level the movie file
specified in the value of the attribute "file".
It has an optional attribute, "size" (default: 2),
which indicates how much the movie is to be scaled when playing back.
If this attribute is specified for level index <b>256</b>, this movie
will be played after completing the last level of the scenario.
<li>&lt;load_screen&gt; displays the file in the attribute "file" in place of the OpenGL loading progress dialog. An optional attribute "scale" defaults to true, and says whether to resize the image to fill the screen. An optional attribute "stretch" defaults to true, and says whether to ignore aspect ratio when scaling the image to fill the screen. Optional attributes "progress_left", "progress_top", "progress_right", and "progress_bottom" specify where to display an optional progress bar, in image co-ordinates. The progress bar will fill left to right if it is wider than it is high, and bottom to top if it is taller than it is wide. Lastly, two optional color child elements can be specified, indices 0 and 1, for background and foreground colors of the progress bar, respectively.
</ul>
<p>
Directories and files are specified in Unix fashion, &lt;dirname&gt;/&lt;dirname&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;,
with a ':' being translated into a '/' in the MacOS.
The root directory for such specifications is the map file's parent directory,
so something like "Music/bang_my_head.mp3" means looking for file "bang_my_head.mp3"
in the directory "Music", which is in the same directory that the map file lives in.
<p>
Aleph One supports playing back MPEG-1 movies, and AIFF, WAV, Ogg/Vorbis, and mp3 music.
<p>

Finally, the &lt;end_screens&gt; element is for specifying which PICT resources
are to be used as the end-of-game screen displays.
This specification is done with these attributes:
<ul>
<li>index: which fake level-index value to use for the end of the game (default: 99);
all chapter screens have the resource ID (1500 + (level index)).
If there is more than one ending chapter screen, then this is for finding the first one.
<li>count: how many in sequence (default: 1), with resource ID's incremented by one for each one.
</ul>
<p>
You can also use &lt;load_screen&gt;, &lt;music&gt;, and &lt;random_order&gt; in a &lt;default_levels&gt; tag in regular &lt;marathon&gt; MML.
<hr>

<h3><a name="appendix1">Appendix 1: Additional Elements</a></h3>

<h4><a name="color">Colors</a></h4>

Colors are specified with the element &lt;color&gt;
colors may be either indexed (being list members), or non-indexed (being in isolation).
The color channels are red, green, and blue, with values that range from 0 to 1.
<ul>
<li>index (mandatory if indexed; must be absent if not indexed)
<li>red
<li>green
<li>blue
</ul>
All the color-channel attributes (red, green, blue) are mandatory.
This example makes color 7 be yellow:
<pre>
&lt;color index="7" red="1" green="1" blue="0"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>

<h4><a name="shape">Shapes</a></h4>

Shapes can be specified with the element &lt;shape&gt;.
A shape specification includes which collection, which color table,
and which sequence or frame; a shape may also be allowed to be blank.
A shape's attributes are
<ul>
<li>coll: which collection (0 to 31)
<li>clut: which color table; default is 0 (0 to 7)
<li>seq: which sequence (0 to 255)
<li>frame: like the above, included if the meaning of "frame" is clearer
in some context.
</ul>
A blank shape is specified as one having no attributes: &lt;shape/&gt;.
A non-blank shape requires the collection and sequence attributes,
and optionally the color-table attribute (default: 0).
<p>

<h4><a name="damage">Damage</a></h4>

Damage is specified with the element &lt;damage&gt;.
Damage features are set with these attributes, which are all optional.
<ul>
<li>type ("true" damage index; none is -1)
<li>flags (0 or 1 [is alien: weaker in easier difficulty levels])
<li>base
<li>random
<li>scale (1 = identity scaling)
</ul>
<p>

<h4><a name="font">Fonts</a></h4>

Fonts are specified with the element &lt;font&gt;
like colors, fonts may be either indexed (being list members), or non-indexed (being in isolation).
<ul>
<li>index (mandatory if indexed; must be absent if not indexed)
<li>name: the font name; it can be a series of names separated by commas or semicolons,
much like HTML font specifications.
If a series of the names, the engine will look for a font with the first name,
and then the second, and so forth, until it finds such a font.
<li>size: the font size in points (standard unit)
<li>style: the font style, which follows MacOS conventions; it is the sum of whichever of these
attributes are used:
<ol>
<li>Bold
<li>Italic
<li value="4">Underline
<li value="8">Outline
<li value="16">Shadow
<li value="32">Condense
<li value="64">Extend
</ol>
Normal is none of these attributes, or 0.
<li>file: this is for SDL support, and indicate which font file to use.
</ul>
None of the font attributes proper are mandatory.
This example sets font 4 to the default font for the computer terminals.
<pre>
&lt;font index="4" name="Courier" size="12" style="0"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>


<h4><a name="boolean">Boolean data</a></h4>

This is not a separate element, but a kind of value of an attribute.
These values for a boolean attribute,
<ul>
<li>1
<li>t
<li>true
</ul>
indicate that a flag is to be on or an action is to be taken.
These values,
<ul>
<li>0
<li>f
<li>false
</ul>
indicate that a flag is to be off or an action is not to be taken.
