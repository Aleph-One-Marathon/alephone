We ask all contributors to agree to the following:

1. You wrote the code. Exceptions may be made for integration of third party libraries; please coordinate with Aleph-One-Marathon organization members first.
2. You understand the code.
3. You agree to contribute it under the GPL v3 or later.
4. You have the legal authority to contribute it under the GPL v3 or later.
5. Your contribution does not knowingly violate any software patents.

For features which substantially affect the behavior of the game in regards to the original trilogy, or for larger patches which may touch many subsystems, it is recommended to coordinate with Aleph-One-Marathon organization members before getting too far into implementation. Aleph One is the primary way of playing the original Marathon trilogy on modern hardware, and we prioritize preserving the original gameplay experience as well as maintaining compatibility with existing scenarios.

You can reach organization members via [Discord](https://discord.gg/c7rEVgY), #alephone on libera.chat, or by opening an issue at https://github.com/aleph-One-Marathon/alephone
