 *  The point of this file is to let us (networking code, in particular) use timing services
 *  with the same source-level API wrapper that Bungie used to access the Mac's Time Manager.
 *
 *  Created by woody on Mon Oct 15 2001.
 *
 *  3 December 2001 (Woody Zenfell): changed dependence on SDL_Threadx's SetRelativeThreadPriority
 *	to simply BoostThreadPriority(), a simpler function with a simpler interface.
 *
 *  14 January 2003 (Woody Zenfell): TMTasks lock each other out while running (better models
 *      Time Manager behavior, so makes code safer).  Also removed missedDeadline stuff.
 */

// The implementation is built on SDL_thread, and approximates the Time Manager behavior.
// Obviously, it's not a perfect emulation.  :)
// In particular, though TMTasks now lock one another out (as they should), TMTasks do not
// (cannot?) effectively lock out the main thread (as they would in Mac OS 9)... but, their
// threads ought to be higher-priority than the main thread, which means that as long as they
// don't block (which they shouldn't anyway), the main thread will not run while they do.

// I probably would have made life easier for myself by using SDL_timer instead, but frankly
// the documentation does not inspire me to trust it.  I'll do things on my own.
