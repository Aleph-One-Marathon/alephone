	made ddp ring work with more than 2 players (upring and downring were confused)
Saturday, July 2, 1994 3:54:12 PM
	simple distribution of map
Friday, July 15, 1994 10:51:38 AM
	gracefully handling players dropping from the game. don't allow quiting from the game while
	we have the ring packet. changed distribution of the map now that we transfer a level at a time.
Sunday, July 17, 1994 4:01:18 PM
	multiple updates per packet
Monday, July 18, 1994 11:51:51 AM
	transfering map in chunks now, since ADSP can only write 64K at a time.
Tuesday, July 19, 1994 7:14:30 PM
	fixed one player ring bug yesterday.
Wednesday, July 20, 1994 12:34:06 AM
	variable number of updates per packet. (can only be adjusted upward, not downward).
Monday, July 25, 1994 9:04:24 PM
	Jason's new algorithm. dropping players and slowing down the ring doesn't work now.
	but performance is much smoother, and better understood, to boot. 
Sunday, August 21, 1994 3:58:23 PM
	about a week ago, added stuff to use the ring to distribute other information, like
	sound or text for the game.

Jan 30, 2000 (Loren Petrich):
	Added some typecasts

Feb. 4, 2000 (Loren Petrich):
	Changed halt() to assert(false) for better debugging
        
Sept-Oct 2001 (Woody Zenfell): (roughly in order)
        Plugged in netcpy/_NET stuff and a couple #ifdef SDL byte-swappers for portable data formats.
        Changed a couple memcpy() calls to memmove() calls as they have overlapping source and dest.
        Allowed the use of the MyTM* functions, which now have SDL_thread-based implementations.
        Added optional NETWORK_FAUX_QUEUE mechanism, should work on either platform.
        It was a good idea, I think, but ultimately fairly pointless.  NETWORK_ADAPTIVE_LATENCY should be better.
        Added optional NETWORK_ADAPTIVE_LATENCY mechanism, should work on either platform.
        Changed some #ifdef mac conditionals to #ifndef NETWORK_IP to better convey what we're worried about.
        Added NETWORK_USE_RECENT_FLAGS option to discard excess flags from the head, rather than tail, of the queue.
        Added... how to say... "copious" comments (ZZZ) at various times as I browsed the source and made changes.
        Found that a basic assumption I was using in my optimizations (i.e. that the game processed action_flags
        at a constant rate) was wrong, which made the Bungie way make a lot more sense.  I now recommend using *none*
        of the three NETWORK_* options (do use NETWORK_IP though of course if appropriate).
        
Nov 13, 2001 (Woody Zenfell):
        Although things were basically OK under favorable conditions, they were IMO too "fragile" - sensitive
        to latency and jitter.  I couldn't help but try again... so NETWORK_ADAPTIVE_LATENCY_2 has been added.
        Also put in NETWORK_SMARTER_FLAG_DITCHING mechanism.

Feb 27, 2002 (Br'fin (Jeremy Parsons)):
	Rewired things to more generally key off of HAVE_SDL_NET than SDL (The Carbon build has SDL_NET, but
		understandably lacks SDL)
	Uses #if HAVE_SDL_NET in place of calls to #ifndef mac to allow SDL networking under Carbon

Mar 3-8, 2002 (Woody Zenfell):
    Changed net distribution stuff to use an STL map to associate distribution types with
    {lossy, handling procedure}.  Now different endstations can have different distribution
    types installed for handling (previously they had to all install the same handlers in the
    same order to get the same distribution type ID's).

/*
I would really like to be able to let the Unysnc packet go around the loop, but it is difficult
	because all the code is currently setup to handle only one packet at a time.
Currently 1 player games (when others are dropped) always have lots of late packets (never get
	acknowledged properly, since they are the only player.)
Note that the unregister isn't fast enough, and that the registration code is stupid.  Also should
	setup the dialog such that it doesn't allow for network play when a player is added.

NetADSPRead() should time out by calling PBControl(dspStatus, ...) to see if there are enough bytes

// In a star (client-server) topology, this should be less of an issue, since overall latency would be related

// ZZZ addition: adaptive latency mechanism.  Here's the problem.  We want to minimize latency, but also mask
// jitter (i.e. variation in latency).  If we see too much latency, the game will feel "sluggish" in the sense
// that your player will respond late to all your commands - might feel sort of like "driving a boat".
// OTOH if we keep latency at the absolute minimum, we expose ourselves to jitter - if there's a "burp" in
// the system somewhere (either in the network or in an endsystem's scheduling), the game freezes up for the
// duration of that burp.  If small burps happen frequently, we might be better off adding an extra frame of
// latency to smooth over all those little burps.

// Before I begin my changes, let me review how things are working (at least with the way the SDL version
// schedules things).

// If a non-server has a *scheduling* burp, that means we see a too-long period with no calls to NetQueueingTask,
// followed by a bunch of calls to NQT to make up for the losses.

// If a ring packet (maybe more than one, depending on the nature of the burp) arrived and was processed during
// that dry spell, we "smeared" - the packet handler grabbed however many input_flags it needed directly from
// the input system instead of taking from the queue that NQT fills (because the queue was empty/not full enough).
// The extra calls to NQT at the end of the dry spell will go into the regular local_queue, but will probably be
// discarded the next time we feed the ring since we'll have too many flags waiting.

// Endstations upring (i.e. which receive the ring packet later) from the burper will (assuming they are not
// simultaneously burping :) ) queue up a bunch of action_flags as normal in NQT while they wait.  (Note that this also applies to
// a situation where network congestion causes a burp "between" stations - e.g. we have to retransmit due to
// lack of ACK, etc.)  When the ring packet gets around to the next endstations, they will discard the oldest
// action_flags and pass along only the newest few (if my NETWORK_USE_RECENT_FLAGS change is active - it used to
// pass along the oldest ones and throw out the newer ones.)  So far, everything looks peachy - we've had to
// freeze our animation while the burp happened, but at least we're not introducing any new latency (i.e.
// we are making sure our local queue is as empty as possible by throwing away extra flags, etc.)

// The problem comes when we look at the server (and NetServerTask).  It makes no effort to empty its queue
// currently - instead, when the ring comes back to it after a burp, it has a lot of extra flags waiting to
// go.  Instead of ditching the old ones, it sends them _all_ along, and tells the non-servers (via the packet's
// required_action_flags) that they owe a lot of flags.  So, when the ring packet gets to them, and they don't
// have enough flags, they "smear" to make up the difference.  The end result is that a lot of extra flags
// end up in the "player" queue - the one where flags sit after being received from the network but before being acted
// on by the main game code.  The main game takes from that queue only at the TICK rate, so if there are extra
// flags sitting there, any new flags will have to wait to be acted on until they make their way through the
// queue - hello latency.

// Here's my crack at a solution.  The server is responsible for making the decisions here.

// Simply ditching old flags at the server the way we do at endstations seems like the simplest way, but I
// believe it has an important drawback: what if the latency in the ring is greater than the duration of a
// TICK?  What if the average latency in the ring is less than the duration of a TICK, but we tend to jitter
// a fair amount over the TICK duration (but, we hope, not much more)?  In the former case, the game would
// proceed at half the normal TICK rate (or worse) because endstations would be constantly starved for data,
// and thus would be stalling the game all the time.  In the latter case, we wouldn't be stalling *all* the
// time, but every time we jittered past the TICK duration - too frequently to make playing pleasant.

// What we need is to adapt to the network conditions - if we seem to be starving a lot, we want to bump up
// the number of action_flags in our queues so we can use the extras to smooth over the gaps.  OTOH though
// if conditions improve, we want to reduce the number of flags so we don't have gratuitous extra latency
// between player inputs and screen updates.  I think one could argue that the code I inherited did the
// first part just fine, but never readjusted the queue size back down to remove latency when possible.
// (Perhaps this is what Jason's comment in the header means?  "(can only be adjusted upward, not downward)")

// Maybe on the cooperatively-scheduled Mac, using very-low-latency interrupts to do time-sensitive processing,
// burps were uncommon.  But on most systems, our code will probably get scheduled erraticly, so we need to
// be more jitter-tolerant.  In particular, we don't want a big burp to build a whole bunch of latency in
// to the rest of the game, if we can recover from it (exposing ourselves to another big burp later, but we
// hope that those are uncommon enough that we'd rather have a responsive game between stalls than a sluggish
// game that is unaffected by stalls).

// Actually this is all building a compelling argument for changing from a ring to a star, since endstation
// latency in a star has much less impact on the overall system (which here I use to mean all machines involved)
// that does endstation latency in a ring, especially as the number of endstations grows.

// So here's how my scheme works: we maintain a sampling window of how many TICKs it's actually taken the ring
// to go around (remember, this is all done by the server).  As this window slides along in time, we track
// (1) the number of rings that needed more time than we're currently allowing, and
// (2) the number of rings that actually needed the amount of time we're allowing (i.e. that were not 'early'
// by a tick or more).
// If (1) exceeds some threshhold, we add in another required_action_flag, so the queue grows a little longer
// to tolerate constant latency or frequent jitter.
// OTOH if (2) is less than some threshhold, we reduce the number of required_action_flags, so the queue
// shrinks and we have less overall latency.
// Update: instead of using the count of rings that were early or late, we just use the average ring latency
// and compare it to our current setting.  That way we can reuse our window data without having to go
// touch all the samples to recalculate stuff.  (Not that it would really take all *that* long, but...)

// which means they'll have to smear again next time... it's not the end of the world, but it defeats the purpose of calling NQT

#endif//NETWORK_ADAPTIVE_LATENCY || NETWORK_ADAPTIVE_LATENCY_2

// Adaptive latency take 2... heh heh...
// Here's the problem with the first effort.  (Or second, if you count FAUX_QUEUE as an effort.)
// It assumes that the engine consumes action_flags at a constant rate, and in particular that if
// the engine starves, it does not take any special steps to catch up later.  Au contraire!, it turns
// out (quite sensibly) that the engine, after starving, consumes action_flags voraciously to try to
// catch back up to real game time.  So let's try this analysis:

// Endstations produce action_flags at a constant, but perhaps jittery, rate of one per GAME_TICK.
// Endstations consume action_flags at a constant, but perhaps jittery, rate of one per GAME_TICK.

// If the ring gets held up somewhere, endstations build up flags in their local_queues.
// The next time it comes around *after reaching the server*, the ring will consume all the extras.
// Observe: this means that, ideally, we should *not* discard action_flags from the local_queue if
// we get the ring packet and we have more than it wants - it should gobble up our extras next time.
// We *could* make sure our extras get eaten - we could increment a counter for every ring that leaves
// us with flags still in our local_queue.  (When a ring leaves us empty, we reset the counter.)
// We could consider incrementing the counter by the NUMBER of flags we have left sitting around, so if
// we have somehow gotten a large number jammed in our queue, it corrects more quickly.
// If the counter exceeds a threshhold, we throw away an action_flag from the head of the queue (stale)
// and reset the counter.
// If an endstation takes too long between flag productions, it "smears" when the ring reaches it.
// The endstation thus produces too many flags.  If we use the above correction mechanism, we will
// compensate eventually by throwing out extra flags.  But if for some reason drift has caused our
// average rate to fall slightly below what's needed, the extra flag or two from smearing will bring
// our production back up to the needed rate - and that in a timely manner.

// Endstations that take too long between consumption binges build up flags in their player_queues. 
// At the next consumption binge, they will eat all the extras.  Note that consumption is tied
// directly to production on an endstation - if the production element runs dry for a while, the consumer
// will not be allowed to consume, even if there are queued flags (in player_queues) available.

// A one-time dry spell and then compensating deluge in the player_queues will be correctly handled by
// the voracious-consumer approach.  The game will freeze up during the dry spell, then suddenly lurch
// ahead several frames to get back to the "present".
// It seems like there could be a problem if the consumer drifts from what's coming to it, but I think
// that having the consumer rate tied to the producer rate - and having everyone agree on that rate by
// the server dictating the net_time - gets around any such problems.

// Actually, I think we should see the following behaviors with regard to net_time:

// If the server's net_time coming in is greater than ours, we should see ourselves smear... unless we recently
// saw a server net_time less than ours, in which case we have queued flags to make up the difference.
// If the server's net_time coming in is less than ours, we should see ourselves ditch a flag.
// (Note that these may not happen at the same packet arrival, but should be nonetheless linked.)

// I have now implemented the flag ditching mechanism outlined above:
#ifdef	NETWORK_SMARTER_FLAG_DITCHING
static int	sFlagDitchingCounter;		// reset if local_queue empties; increments by local_queue leftovers otherwise.

enum {
    kFlagDitchingThreshhold = TICKS_PER_SECOND	// if counter exceeds this, ditch a flag and reset counter.
};
#endif
// We're really splitting hairs at this point.  I think this is only better than the Bungie mechanism if
// we have several late packets in a row followed by a return to normal - and even then we're just honoring
// the user's input a little more accurately.  Oh well, this was probably a poorly spent 15 minutes, but it
// can only help, I think...
// I can convince myself of some pretty odd things if I think about them long enough.  ;)

// Does the net_time mechanism alone solve everything??

// dynamic_world is not allowed to get ahead of net_time.
// Suppose we see a ring packet every three GAME_TICKs.  The ring packet should carry three action_flags with it.
// Let's watch the action starting at 0 (this may not be EXACTLY what the ring protocol does, since it has special
// startup stuff, but if this bothers you, imagine the latency suddenly jumps up to this level at some time T.
// Our "0", then, is the offset from some point in time T.):

// NQT queues a local flag.  Our local net_time increases.  Consumer tries to update dynamic_world, but there's not
// enough data.
// Same thing.  Now local net_time is 2, and there are 2 flags in local_queue.  player_queue is still empty, so
// dynamic_world cannot update.
// Same thing.  net_time is 3, there are 3 flags in local_queue, and player_queue is empty.  dynamic_world is oddly still.
// The ring packet comes in!  It has a required_flags of 1, and every player's data in the packet has 1 flag in it.
// The server's net time was 1 when the packet was sent.  *We set our local net_time to 1.*  We move a local_flag into the
// packet and pass the ring on.  net_time is 1, there are 2 flags in local_queue, and player_queue has 1.
// NQT queues a local flag.  net_time is 2.  There are 3 flags in local_queue.

// NQT queues a local flag.  net_time is 4.  There are 5 flags in local_queue.  player_queue is empty.  dynamic_world is stopped.
// The ring packet comes in!  required_flags is 3; every player has 3 flags.  The server's net_time was 4.
// Our net_time agrees with the server's.  We pack up 3 local_flags for the packet and pass it on.
// net_time = 4, |local_queue| = 2, |player_queue| = 3, DWTC = 1.
// dynamic_world wants to update to time 4, and CAN - it voraciously consumes all 3 player_flags.

// DRAW net_time = 7, |local_queue| = 2, |player_queue| = 0, DWTC = 7.

// Note: if latency suddenly drops back to 1 GAME_TICK per ring, the extra flags in local_queue will drain, and DWTC
// will be able to track net_time more closely.
// If instead latency stays high, we will eventually discard the extra elements in local_queue, reducing overall
// user-input-to-screen-update latency.

// Note: if bandwidth is no problem but latency is high ("long fat pipe"?), we could have multiple updates "on the wire"
// at a time, thus letting DWTC remain in sync with net_time -> smoother updates.  Our net_time would stay a few ticks
// behind the server's net_time.

// OK, this behavior is not so good because we're only drawing the screen at 10fps (once every 3 GAME_TICKs).
// Options are to speculatively update dynamic_world, thus letting DWTC track net_time (but without "real data" to go on), (HARD),
// or to delay the engine's view of net_time by some amount (EASY), introducing even more latency but smoothing out the frames.

// How do we decide to raise or lower the amount of delay?
// Should be based on, when a packet comes in, how many player_flags there are?  How DWTC compares to (net_time - delay)?
