Wednesday, June 29, 1994 9:14:21 PM
	made ddp ring work with more than 2 players (upring and downring were confused)
Saturday, July 2, 1994 3:54:12 PM
	simple distribution of map
Friday, July 15, 1994 10:51:38 AM
	gracefully handling players dropping from the game. don't allow quiting from the game while
	we have the ring packet. changed distribution of the map now that we transfer a level at a time.
Sunday, July 17, 1994 4:01:18 PM
	multiple updates per packet
Monday, July 18, 1994 11:51:51 AM
	transfering map in chunks now, since ADSP can only write 64K at a time.
Tuesday, July 19, 1994 7:14:30 PM
	fixed one player ring bug yesterday.
Wednesday, July 20, 1994 12:34:06 AM
	variable number of updates per packet. (can only be adjusted upward, not downward).
Monday, July 25, 1994 9:04:24 PM
	Jason's new algorithm. dropping players and slowing down the ring doesn't work now.
	but performance is much smoother, and better understood, to boot. 
Sunday, August 21, 1994 3:58:23 PM
	about a week ago, added stuff to use the ring to distribute other information, like
	sound or text for the game.

Jan 30, 2000 (Loren Petrich):
	Added some typecasts

Feb. 4, 2000 (Loren Petrich):
	Changed halt() to assert(false) for better debugging
        
Sept-Oct 2001 (Woody Zenfell): (roughly in order)
        Plugged in netcpy/_NET stuff and a couple #ifdef SDL byte-swappers for portable data formats.
        Changed a couple memcpy() calls to memmove() calls as they have overlapping source and dest.
        Allowed the use of the MyTM* functions, which now have SDL_thread-based implementations.
        Added optional NETWORK_FAUX_QUEUE mechanism, should work on either platform.
        It was a good idea, I think, but ultimately fairly pointless.  NETWORK_ADAPTIVE_LATENCY should be better.
        Added optional NETWORK_ADAPTIVE_LATENCY mechanism, should work on either platform.
        Changed some #ifdef mac conditionals to #ifndef NETWORK_IP to better convey what we're worried about.
        Added NETWORK_USE_RECENT_FLAGS option to discard excess flags from the head, rather than tail, of the queue.
        Added... how to say... "copious" comments (ZZZ) at various times as I browsed the source and made changes.
        Found that a basic assumption I was using in my optimizations (i.e. that the game processed action_flags
        at a constant rate) was wrong, which made the Bungie way make a lot more sense.  I now recommend using *none*
        of the three NETWORK_* options (do use NETWORK_IP though of course if appropriate).
        
Nov 13, 2001 (Woody Zenfell):
        Although things were basically OK under favorable conditions, they were IMO too "fragile" - sensitive
        to latency and jitter.  I couldn't help but try again... so NETWORK_ADAPTIVE_LATENCY_2 has been added.
        Also put in NETWORK_SMARTER_FLAG_DITCHING mechanism.

Feb 27, 2002 (Br'fin (Jeremy Parsons)):
	Rewired things to more generally key off of HAVE_SDL_NET than SDL (The Carbon build has SDL_NET, but
		understandably lacks SDL)
	Uses #if HAVE_SDL_NET in place of calls to #ifndef mac to allow SDL networking under Carbon

Mar 3-8, 2002 (Woody Zenfell):
    Changed net distribution stuff to use an STL map to associate distribution types with
    {lossy, handling procedure}.  Now different endstations can have different distribution
    types installed for handling (previously they had to all install the same handlers in the
    same order to get the same distribution type ID's).

Feb 5, 2003 (Woody Zenfell):
        Preliminary support for resuming saved-games networked.
        
Feb 13, 2003 (Woody Zenfell):
        Resuming saved-games as network games works.

May 24, 2003 (Woody Zenfell):
	Split out ring-protocol-specific stuff from here to RingGameProtocol.cpp.
	This is multiple-game-protocol-savvy now.
	Support for graceful handling of unknown streaming-data packet types.
        
July 03, 2003 (jkvw):
        Added network lua scripts.

September 17, 2004 (jkvw):
	NAT-friendly networking.  That is, joiners behind firewalls should be able to play.
	Also moved to TCPMess for TCP communications.
*/

/*
I would really like to be able to let the Unysnc packet go around the loop, but it is difficult
	because all the code is currently setup to handle only one packet at a time.
Currently 1 player games (when others are dropped) always have lots of late packets (never get
	acknowledged properly, since they are the only player.)
Note that the unregister isn't fast enough, and that the registration code is stupid.  Also should
	setup the dialog such that it doesn't allow for network play when a player is added.
*/

/*
NetADSPRead() should time out by calling PBControl(dspStatus, ...) to see if there are enough bytes
clearly this is all broken until we have packet types
