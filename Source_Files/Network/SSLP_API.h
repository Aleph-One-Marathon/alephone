 *  Simple Service Location Protocol (hope that name's ok with everyone, did not research it at all)
 *	(Near-)conflict with well-known Secure Socket Layer is unfortunate, but I doubt anyone will mistake them :) .
 *	Someone smart has surely done this better somewhere and has probably proven various characteristics,
 *	but I decided to hack out my own anyway.  Tough.
 *
 *	for the Aleph One project, to do NBP-ish player location on non-AppleTalk networks.  The current
 *	implementation is a (significant) simplification of what this could or perhaps ought to be, but
 *	it's sufficient for Aleph One's needs, which is all that matters right now.  Besides, like I said,
 *	I'm sure there's something better already out there that's designed for heavyweight application.

// SSLP does not "guarantee" anything about its findings - it's intended merely as an aid.  This means (in particular)
// a host that found a service via SSLP cannot assume that the service definitely exists at the host and port provided...
// but it's a probably a good place to look ;)

// Note: here's one sticky part, at the moment, for the sake of laziness, I share these constants between
// the ServiceInstance (part of the API) and the SSLP_Packet network data format.  Really, they should be
// disentangled, but then I'd have to worry about them being different.  ;)
#define	SSLP_MAX_TYPE_LENGTH	32
#define	SSLP_MAX_NAME_LENGTH	32

// SSLP_ServiceInstance does not get written to network or file, so struct alignment no big whoop
// sslps_address must have both parts in network (big-endian) byte order, though.
struct SSLP_ServiceInstance {
    char		sslps_type[SSLP_MAX_TYPE_LENGTH];
    char		sslps_name[SSLP_MAX_NAME_LENGTH];
    IPaddress		sslps_address;	// "host" part ignored by SSLP_*_Service_Discovery()
};


// N.B.!!: currently, for ease of implementation, only one service can be searched for and only one service can
// be made discoverable at a time.  (You may do one of each simultaneously.)
// No wildcard or regex matches are supported at this time.


////// General functions //////

// If using a non-threaded implementation, you will need to be sure to call this function every once in a while
// to give SSLP some processing time.  Once a second ought to be plenty, but more or less often should also work.
// More frequent calls result in more responsive updates.  Try to avoid taking more than 5 seconds between calls.
// In a threaded implementation, threads will worry about themselves, and you never need to call SSLP_Pump().
void
SSLP_Pump();



////// Trying to locate remote services //////

// SSLP_Locate_Service_Instances: Starts looking for service instances of inServiceType.
// If one is found, inFoundCallback is invoked immediately (potentially in a different thread than was used to call
// Locate_Service_Instances).  Consider the ServiceInstance* to be valid until noted otherwise... you may store a reference
// (no need to copy).  You won't get another foundCallback for the same instance.
// If one is lost, inLostCallback is invoked immediately (again, potentially in a different thread).  You won't get
// a lostCallback unless there had been a matching foundCallback (err, unless you gave NULL for foundCallback, which would
// probably not be very useful).
// Once inLostCallback returns, consider the ServiceInstance* invalid (i.e. hope you copied anything you needed).
// If a service is found with a different name but at the same host and port as an existing one, inNameChangedCallback is invoked.
// (you guessed it... from a different thread.)
// Any Callback(s) may be NULL, in which case you receive no notification of the corresponding event.
// The ServiceInstance pointer may be used to *identify* a service instance, while it's valid... that is,
// no need to "deep compare" the whole records.  In particular, inLostCallback and inNameChangedCallback will get
// a pointer that was previously passed to inFoundCallback.
// NB!! in the current (limited) implementation, you may only have one service-location attempt ongoing at a time.
// Calling this function twice without an intervening call to Stop_Locating_Service_Instances is an ERROR, and may
// result in the termination of the entire application!

// One more note: in the single-threaded SSLP implementation, callbacks will occur in whatever thread calls
// SSLP_Pump(), so synchronization is much less of an issue.

// After this call returns, the callback functions will no longer be called.
// After this call returns, ALL ServiceInstances that were passed to the "found" callback are invalid.
// You will not receive "lost" callbacks for them.

// The "host" part of the address is ignored... the "port" says which port on the local machine the service
// may be contacted at.
// NB!! in the current (limited) implementation, only one service instance may be available for discovery
// at a time... calling this function twice without an intervening Disallow_Service_Discovery is an ERROR and
// may abort the entire application!

// Also stops hinting the applicable service-instance(s), if appropriate.
// NB!! in the current (limited) implementation, the argument provided is ignored altogether.  Any hinting is stopped and
// the service-instance currently being published is unpublished.  It is an ERROR in the current implementation to call this
// twice without an intervening call to Allow_Service_Discovery (possibly via Hint_Service_Discovery), and doing so may
// abort the entire application!
